# WSL2 tips and tricks
I'm using WSL2 on Windows 11 for my new day job. So far it has been great but also involves a lot of learning. Here's my findings for anyone to use.

This setup assumes Windows 11, and a decently specc'ed machine. I'm running 32GB of RAM and an NVIDIA graphics card on a new Intel processor. I am also using the Microsoft official WSL install of Ubuntu. I have nothing against others and may try out Debian in the future, but for now, this is working well enough to keep things moving.

## Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
